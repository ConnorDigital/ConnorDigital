- âš¡ Fun fact: The term 'bug' to describe a computer glitch originated in 1947 when Grace Hopper, a computer scientist, found a moth causing a malfunction in the Harvard Mark II computer. She removed the moth and taped it to the computer's logbook, coining the term 'debugging' for fixing computer glitches." This incident gave rise to the common usage of the term "bug" in the context of computer programming errors.
